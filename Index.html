		<p><div class="omg">On May 21, 1965, Ontario led the way for colleges of applied arts and technology with the creation of its college system.[citation needed] In 1967, Niagara College’s Welland Campus was established in response to the provincial initiative to create many such institutions, providing career-oriented diploma and certificate courses, as well as continuing education programs.

		In 1998 Niagara College opened its Niagara-on-the-Lake Campus in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. In 2004, Niagara College’s hospitality, tourism and culinary programs moved from the Maid of the Mist Campus to new facilities at the Niagara-on-the-Lake Campus. In 2002, Niagara College launched its Niagara College Teaching Winery, the first commercial teaching winery in Canada, and in 2011 it launched the Niagara College Teaching Brewery, also the first of its kind in Canada. Today, the culinary programs, teaching winery and teaching brewery are all part of Niagara College’s Canadian Food and Wine Institute.

		In response to the rapid growth of Niagara’s tourism sector and the anticipated demand for thousands of new workers, the college established the Tourism Industry Development Centre (TIDC). Housed on the Maid of the Mist Campus in Niagara Falls, the TIDC serves as a dedicated industry development and training resource for the hospitality and tourism sector. In 2007, the Ontario Street Site was added for the expanding Health & Community Studies programs.

		In 2008, Niagara College embarked on a $90 million campus redevelopment as part of the college’s overall master plan, which included significant improvements and additions to the Welland and Niagara-on-the-Lake Campuses. The redevelopment project was designed to increase capacity in programs that serve key industries in Niagara, including skilled trades, technology, winery and viticulture and hospitality and tourism, while providing much-needed improvements to aging facilities. The project was also a response to the college’s growth, including a 10.1 percent increase in total enrolment for the fall 2008 term - the largest increase among all Ontario colleges.[citation needed]

		Construction at the Welland Campus included a 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) expansion to the Rankin Technology Centre, as well as a new Academic Wing, a Library and Learning Commons, a two-storey Athletics Centre a Student Centre and the $40 million Applied Health Institute (AHI), funded by the federal and provincial governments under the Knowledge Infrastructure Program (KIP). The facility brings all of Niagara College’s health programs into one complex and created space for new programs and 1,000 new students. The AHI includes classrooms and simulation labs, a dental clinic, community health clinic and a 350-seat auditorium.

		At the Niagara-on-the-Lake Campus, the project included construction of a Wine Visitor + Education Centre, which integrates academic programming, facilities for the unique Niagara College Teaching Winery and an educational centre for students, industry and visitors. The project also saw an expansion of culinary facilities and the construction of the Niagara College Teaching Brewery. The project was completed in spring 2011.

		The Learning Commons was renamed the Eva M. Lewis Learning Commons and Library in April 2016 following a $2.6 million donation from the estate of Eva M. Lewis. It was the largest private donation in the history of the school.</div></p>
